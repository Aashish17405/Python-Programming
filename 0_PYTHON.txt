=>PYTHON : Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
  ->It is an interpreted, object oriented, procedural and functional language.
  ->It is easy to learn and write because it does not have any ';' , '{}' and it has many inbuilt libraries.
  ->It has wide range of applications : 1)AI Artificial intelligence
                                        2)ML Machine learning
                                        3)DS Data Science
                                        4)Web development
                                        5)Software development
    This is what makes python a general purpose language.

=>we can code python in REPL i.e read evaluate print loop  : we open it by typing python and clicking enter in terminal
  or command prompt but the disadantage is we cannot manage our code and our code will be limited to single line so we
  use other platforms to write code

=>TO GET DOCS OF PYTHON : follow the steps : 
  ->Install python and add to path
  ->Open command prompt 
  ->Enter "python"
  ->You can see your python version that is installed in your system
  ->Along with version you will see some commands like 'help' , 'copyright' etc.
