# DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM : base 10 numbers. It has values from 0 to 9.

# BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM : base 2 numbers. It has only 2 digits 0 and 1.

# OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM : base 8 numbers. It has values from 0 to 7.

# HEXA-DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM : base 16 numbers. It has values from 0 to 9 and for further representation A(10) to F(15)


# CONVERSION OF DECIMAL TO BINARY
print(bin(25))
# In the output we will get '0b11001' by seeing 0b we can say that it is a binary number

# CONVERSION OF BINARY TO DECIMAL
print(0b11001)
# By seeing 0b compiler understands that it is a binary number

# CONVERSION OF DECIMAL TO OCTAL
print(oct(25))
# In the output we will get '0o31' by seeing 0o we can say that it is a octal number

# CONVERSION OF OCTAL TO DECIMAL
print(0o31)
# By seeing 0o compiler understands that it is a octal number

# CONVERSION OF DECIMAL TO HEXA-DECIMAL
print(hex(25))
# In the output we will get '0x19' by seeing 0x we can say that it is a hexadecimal number

# CONVERSION OF HEXA-DECIMAL TO DECIMAL
print(0x19)
# By seeing 0x compiler understands that it is a hexadecimal number
